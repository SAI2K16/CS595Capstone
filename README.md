Master Git and GitHub in 2 days

Learn Git and Github in 2 days. I have done that through the following method. Please follow my instructions to learn quickly by doing hands on.

An intro :-"Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. So they are not the same thing: Git the tool, GitHub the service for projects that uses Git."

Step 1 : Git installation

Follow the instructions here to install Git on Windows.

Follow the instructions here to install Git on Mac.

To install Git on Linux.

On Linux, open a terminal and install Git via your package manager. For example, if you are using Ubuntu or another Debian-based distribution, 
run sudo apt-get install git. If you're using Fedora, run sudo yum install git. Now open a new terminal, and you will be able to run Git commands. For example, try running git --version.

Step 2 : How to Use Git and GitHub

I am talking about a free course from coursera online university. Just follow their video lectures and do the small tasks. Each video is maximum of 3 minutes and excercises are great! We will not get completion certificate as we are not paid customers. If you want to get a valid certificate, you can enrol in the course. Although the course is designed for 3 weeks, it hardly takes 1 day to complete. Courses were designed for working professionals.
